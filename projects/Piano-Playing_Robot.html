                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p class="reg_link">The Piano-Playing Robot is a two-year Capstone project self-sponsered by a team of four
                    along with the <a href="https://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph-459-479/"><u>ENPH Project Lab</u>.</a>,
                    currently <strong>working-in-progress</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to provide accessile, live piano music at a professional-level caliber without
                    the need for a real-life musician. The project aims to design a robotic hand mechanism capable of replicating human pianists' ability to play
                    different dynamics, articulations, and pitches on a standard upright piano.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first year of the project timeline, we have developed the project proposal, and aim to develop one
                    robotic finger capable of playing dynamics from <em>pp</em> (very soft) to <em>ff</em> (very strong) and 
                    different note lengths. Finger-to-hand extension, lateral motion (pitches), and audio calibration will be
                    the focus of next year.

                            Once we acquire the necessary position/velocity data to generate a motion profile,
                            we need an actuator to excecute these instructions, and the actuator we have
                            selected is the voice coil.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A rotary voice coil is a type of motor containg a coil and permanent magnets. 
                            Its basic principle follows the Lorentz Force Law, where the magnetic flux generated
                            from two permanent magnets interacts with the current-carrying coil, producing a
                            magnetic force. The magnitude of the force can be calculated by:

                            $$F = nBIℓ$$

                            where
                            <ul>
                                <li>n = number of loops in the coil</li>
                                <li>B = magnetic field strength</li>
                                <li>I = current</li>
                                <li>ℓ = length of one side of the coil</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <div class="alea_container">

                        <p>
                            As shown in the diagram above, we see that when magnetic flux is running from
                            the north pole to the south pole, and two sides of the coil have current running
                            in the opposite directions. By Right-hand rule, we can tell that the magnetic force
                            generated from both magnets is towards the -x direction. As soon as the coil with 
                            out-of-page current reaches the red magnet, the magnetic force will switch direction, 
                            allowing the coil to move toward the +x direction.

                            Figure 3 shows the schematic diagram of another paper utilizing a voice coil to achieve 
                            downward forces to press a pinao key. With this setup in mind, we have developed our own
                            version of rotary voice coil to achieve the pressing and releasing of the piano key.

                            The figure above is the CAD model of our actuator design. The finger and coil is one
                            solid body connected to the base using two spring steel flexure bearings, and two permanent
                            magnets are mounted at the back of the base. When there is current running through the coil, 
                            the finger will be moved to the desired position by the magnetic force; when current is turned
                            off, the spring force in the flexure bearings will restore the finger back to it's original
                            position, achieving the release action.
