                            <p>
                                The primary objectives of the structural analysis is to ensure the mechanical
                                integrity and the peformance of the satellite under various loads and 
                                environmental conditions it will experience during launch, deloyment, and
                                operation in space. Specifically, the structural mechanical simulation utilizes
                                ANSYS Mechanical to verify whether or not the design meets the following critical criterion:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>the Margin of Safety (MoS) for all materials must be above zero;</li>
                                    <li>the resonance frequency must be above cetain level, the specific
                                        value varies depending on the Launch Provider;</li>
                                    <li>evaluate the deformation of the satellite under quasi-static
                                         loading in all directions;</li>
                                    <li>evaluate the performance of the satellite under stochastic 
                                        vibrational loading in all directions during launch.

                                To achieve the objectives, the analysis approach involves performing mechanical
                                simulation to a finite element model (FEM) of the satellite structure, capturing the essential
                                features and behaviours of the full-scale structure while reducing the computational
                                complexity. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The FEM is first generated through simplifications, including:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>neglecting electronic chips with minimal mass contribution on PCBs;

                                    <li>representing PCBs as shell elements, capturing in-plane and bending deformations;</li>
                                    <li>representing heavy components with minimal structural deformation as point masses,
                                        preserving inertial effects and mass distribution;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>representing fasteners as stiff spring elements with defined preload forces,
                                        simulating clamping effects;

                                </ol>                                
                            </p>
                            <p>then, the simplified model is discretized into smaller and manageable elements 
                                for numerical analysis through meshing.
                            </p>
                            <p>In order to generate high-quality meshes resulting in higher simulation accuracy,
                                the following key steps need to be considered:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>partition the model into regions based on geometries, and apply different mesh types in each

                                        incorporate adaptive mesh refinement by setting coarser mesh in less critical regions
                                        and higher element density in regions with higher stress concentrations or contact surfaces;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>examine mesh convergence by starting with a coarser mesh and refine it progressively, 
                                        ensuring results do not change significantly with finer meshes.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                Modal analysis is a numerical technique used to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of 
                                the satellite structure. It helps ensuring the structural robustness against dynamic vibrational loading 
                                by checking that resonance does not occur.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The first five modes and their natural frequencies is a sufficient representative of the overall system, 
                                and a critical frequency is given by ESA, requiring the first natural frequency must not be less than the
                                critical frequency. Vibration modes with modal effective mass greater than 10% of the total mass are 
                                reported as critical modes, which might need to be carefully analyzed and controlled in the future.
