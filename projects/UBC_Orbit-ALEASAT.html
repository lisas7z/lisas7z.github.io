                    <p class="reg_link"><u><a href="https://www.ubcorbit.com/">UBC Orbit</a></u> is a 
                        satellite design team comprising over 100 undergraduate and graduate
                        students from a variety of disciplines. 
                        <u><a href="">ALEASAT</a></u> is a 1U (10cm x 10cm x 10cm) LEO (low Earth orbit) observation
                        satellite that can be used by radio amateurs in disaster monitor and
                        relief opeartions through image transmission directly from the satellite
                        to the ground station. ALEASAT is currently being developed by student members
                        of UBC Orbit and SFU Satellite Design Team, and the project is supported
                        by UBC, the Radio Amateurs of Canada, and the

                        (ESA). The project is still in the process of building and testing with an aim to launch in

                <h2>Contribution</h2>
                <p>I joined the team as a Structure team member in early 2024, handling tasks including:
                    <ol>
                        <li>performing CAD modifications and creating assemblies in <strong>OnShape</strong>;
                        </li>
                        <li>conducting design reviews to ensure manufacturability, assembly fesability,
                            and compliance with industry standards.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    I was promoted as the <strong>Simulation Co-lead</strong> late 2024, with a shift in focus to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>conducting structural analysis using FEA with <strong>ANSYS Mechanical</strong>;
                        </li>
                        <li>generating detailed structural analysis report in compliance with ESA standards to
                            ensure design qualifications; 
                        </li>
                        <li>participate in testing plan/facility development;</li>
                        <li>performing system integration between the Structure and the Payload Subsystem 
                            (specifically designing the on-boarding camera mounting system).
