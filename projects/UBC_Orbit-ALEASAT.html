                        to the ground station. ALEASAT is currently being developed by student members

                                The primary objectives of the structural analysis is to ensure the mechanical
                                integrity and the peformance of the satellite under various loads and 
                                environmental conditions it will experience during launch, deloyment, and
                                operation in space. Specifically, the structural mechanical simulation utilizes
                                ANSYS Mechanical to verify whether or not the design meets the following critical criterion:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>the Margin of Safety (MoS) for all materials must be above zero;</li>
                                    <li>the resonance frequency must be above cetain level, the specific
                                        value varies depending on the Launch Provider;</li>

                                        vibrational loading in all directions during launch.

                                To achieve the objectives, the analysis approach involves performing mechanical
                                simulation to a finite element model (FEM) of the satellite structure, capturing the essential
                                features and behaviours of the full-scale structure while reducing the computational
                                complexity.

                                The FEM is first generated through simplifications, including:

                                    <li>representing fasteners as stiff spring elements with defined preload forces,
                                        simulating clamping effects;

                            </p>
                            <p>then, the simplified model is discretized into smaller and manageable elements 
                                for numerical analysis through meshing.

                                Note that preload forces are calculated by $$T = KDP$$ where

                                Modal analysis is a numerical technique used to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of 
                                the satellite structure. It helps ensuring the structural robustness against dynamic vibrational loading 
                                by checking that resonance does not occur.
                            </p>

                                The first five modes and their natural frequencies is a sufficient representative of the overall system, 
                                and a critical frequency is given by ESA, requiring the first natural frequency must not be less than the
                                critical frequency. Vibration modes with modal effective mass greater than 10% of the total mass are 
                                reported as critical modes, which might need to be carefully analyzed and controlled in the future.

                                that the structure reaches equilibrium at each step of the loading process. 
                                In our simulation, a 20g acceleration will be applied in each principal direction, simulating static
